## Project 1: Simple Cipher
This project implements two classic encryption techniques: Vigenère Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher.

Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The algorithm uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext.

Rail Fence Cipher
The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern and reading them out in rows. The number of "rails" or rows determines the level of encryption.

## Project 2: DES Algorithm
This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm using bit manipulation techniques.

Data Encryption Standard (DES)
DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It operates on blocks of data and uses a 56-bit key. DES has been widely used in various applications due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
