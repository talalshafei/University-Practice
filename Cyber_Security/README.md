## Project 1: Simple Cipher
This project implements two classic encryption techniques: Vigenère Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher.

Vigenère Cipher
The Vigenère Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. The algorithm uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext.

Rail Fence Cipher
The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges the plaintext letters by writing them in a zigzag pattern and reading them out in rows. The number of "rails" or rows determines the level of encryption.

## Project 2: DES Algorithm
This project implements the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm using bit manipulation techniques.

Data Encryption Standard (DES)
DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It operates on blocks of data and uses a 56-bit key. DES has been widely used in various applications due to its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Project 3: SSL/TLS Handshake Analysis with Wireshark Lab
focusing on the communication between a client and an e-commerce server. By analyzing captured packets, I gained insights into the various SSL record types and the information exchanged during the handshake. This included examining fields like content type, nonces, cipher suites, and certificates. The lab helped solidify my understanding of how secure communication is established over a network using SSL/TLS.

## Project 4: Packet Filtering with Firewall Rules
Explored firewall rules and their influence on network traffic. I analyzed example rules to understand how to control inbound and outbound connections based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols. The importance of crafting secure rules to prevent attacks like unauthorized web proxy access or port misuse was also highlighted.
