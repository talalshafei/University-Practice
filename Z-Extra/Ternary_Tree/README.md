# Overview

In this assignment, we are going to work with tree structures. The case study we will consider is a generic version tree 
that can be used to record different versions of software. Software configuration management (SCM) is the process of 
tracking and controlling changes in the software. the version control system can be defined as software that allows 
you to create versions of elements and be involved in different versions independently from each other. The overall 
process of introducing versions involves both their creation and the implementation of structures for their storage. 
Typically, the structures used are either chains or trees.

In this task, a custom TernaryTree data type for version control will be contructed using Haskell. In each node, this tree will 
hold a string and a level value representing the corresponding node.
