# Project Overview
The project aims to design and implement a hardware solution in Verilog for generating Fibonacci sequences. It involves creating a data path to perform the necessary calculations and a finite state machine to control the sequence generation process.

# Features
Data Path: The data path is responsible for performing arithmetic operations required to generate Fibonacci numbers.
Finite State Machine (FSM): The FSM controls the sequence generation process, ensuring correct sequencing of operations.
Fibonacci Sequence Generation: The implemented hardware generates Fibonacci numbers based on the provided input parameters.
Modular Design: The project is structured in a modular manner, facilitating easy understanding and modification.
