## Project 1: Simple Assembly
A basic assembly project introducing fundamental concepts.

## Project 2: Intermediate Assembly
A slightly more challenging assembly project with additional complexity.

## Project 3: Basic C Programming
Using C programming language to program microprocessors.

## Project 4: Full Sensors System
Implementation of three nodes in C:

- Sensing Node: Gathers data from sensors or input sources.
- Logging (central) Node: Manages storage and logging of data.
- User Node: Interacts with the user to display information.
